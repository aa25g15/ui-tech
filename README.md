## Web and Browser Fundamentals
### What happens when you type a website in your browser?
* 

## HTML

### Semantic HTML

### Accesibility

## CSS
### Position Property
* Static - Default. The elements is positioned as in natural flow of the document.
* Absolute - The element is positioned w.r.t the closest positioned (non-staic) ancestor
* Relative - The element is positioned w.r.t its natural position
* Fixed - The element is positioned w.r.t the window
* Sticky - The element is positioned relative initially and then when user scrolls and a certain offset is passed, the element takes the position fixed

### Selectors
* ID selector
```css
#submit-button {
  color: red;
}
```
* Class selector
```css
.submit-button {
  color: red;
}
```
* Element selector
```css
button {
  color: red;
}
```
* Immediate child selectors
* Selecting all nested children
```css
.parent-class .child-class {
  color: red;
}
```
* Sibling selectors
* Attribute selectors
```css
[data-component="a3-icon"]{
  color: red;
}
```

## JavaScript
* Remember JS is a synchronous single-threaded language but the browser event-loop and promises makes it exhibit async functionality
* Synchronous means that the code is executed in the sequence in which it is written, waiting for the previous instruction to finish executing

### Data Types
* Strings
  * Remember strings are immutable in JS!!!!!!! I have made this silly mistake before too, if they were not then any hacker could alter them and change references causing security breaches

### Promises, callbacks, async, await

### Function call, bind, apply

### Currying

### Hoisting
* In hoisting, it appears that the interpretor moves the declarations of functions, classes and variables to the top of their scope before executing the code such that their value or declaration is accessible before the line at which they are defined.
* There are 3 types of hoisting:
  1. Value hoisting - The value of the declaration is accessible before it is actually declared. This is true for functions, generator functions, async functions and async generator functions.
  ```javascript
  calc(5,10); // Will log 15

  function calc(a,b) {
    console.log(a + b);
  }

  // Note - If you use const calc = () => {}, this will throw referenceError
  ```
  2. Declaration hoisting - The declaration is accessible before it is actually declared although its value is always undefined. This is true for "var" declarations.
  ```javascript
  console.log(a); // Output - undefined

  var a = 10;
  ```
  3. When a hoisted declarations taints the scope in which it is declared such that accessing it before it is declared throws a ReferenceError - This is true for const, let and class. You cannot access variables declared with const and let and classes before they are declared in their scope.
  ```javascript
  const dog = new Dog(); // ReferenceError

  class Dog {}
  ```

### Closures
* Functions form closures in JS through which the variables available in their lexical scope are available to the functions themselves.

### Debounce
* Debounce is a technique through which multiple function calls are combined to a single call. The target function is called only after a certain time has passed after the last call was made. Its common applications include a search bar.

### Throttle
* Throttle is a technique by which the target function is called at a certain rate only. The target function is called and then a certain time must pass after this before it is allowed to be called again.

### Difference Between Arrow Functions and Normal Functions
* The this keyword in an arrow function points to its lexical scope but in a normal function, it points to the function's object

## OS
### Threads
* An application has multiple processes, those processes can then either be single threaded or multi-threaded.
* A process is an application being executed
* Each process has code, data, files
  * For a multi-threaded process, each thread does a different task but these threads can run concurrently increasing efficiency and responsiveness of the app
  * The code, data and files are shared between threads which saves system resources and is economical
